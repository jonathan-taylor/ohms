<h3>About OHMS</h3>

<p>The Online Homework Management System (OHMS) was started by 
Dennis Sun and Praveen Bommannavar in 2012. Its first users were the
180 students in the Autumn 2012 offering of Stats 60, the introductory
statistics course at Stanford. Since then, the project has expanded to
courses across Stanford.</p>

<p>OHMS combines an expressive language for authoring homework
questions with a flexible backend based on Google Drive to 
facilitate grading and data analysis. As such, it is appropriate for 
homeworks that can be automatically graded and for homeworks that require 
manual grading (and especially those that are a mix of the two).</p>

<p>The OHMS project is open source and always looking for
contributors. Please see our <a
href=http://www.github.com/dlsun/ohms>github</a> page for more information.</p>
